Therefore, the default routing prefix is /16. /8 is the default routing prefix for class A IP addresses, while /24 is the default routing prefix for class C IP addresses.

      "explanation":"To connect a private network, home or business, to the Internet, you must have a router with a public IP address. The public address allows hosts on the Internet to send packets to the router. To connect a private network, home or business, to the Internet, you must have a router with a public IP address. The public address allows hosts on the Internet to send packets to the router. When connecting a private network to the Internet, only the router interface connected to the Internet needs a public address. You can then use Network Address Translation (NAT) and assign private addresses to hosts on your private network (including all routers on the private network). The NAT router translates your private addresses into the public address. You can even use NAT to place publicly available hosts, such as web servers, on the private network (although these servers are often placed in a special subnet connected to the Internet and assigned public addresses). With port address translation, incoming messages sent to the publicly available servers are relayed to the private network. Servers that hold confidential data, such as database servers, are normally placed on the private network, and can only be contacted directly by the necessary devices (such as a web server)."

To find the number of valid hosts, n = the number of unmasked bits in the mask. In this example, there are 16 unmasked bits in the mask. Therefore, the number of available hosts is 2 to the 16th power - 2, which equals 65534."
