            "incorrect_answers__003":"Increased number of collision domains AND Increased number of broadcast domains",
            "explanation":"Create VLANs to increase the number of broadcast domains and to implement security. Each VLAN is in its own broadcast domain. Broadcast traffic within the VLAN goes only to the members of the VLAN. Members of one VLAN can only communicate with members in the same VLAN through the switch. A router or a Layer 3 switch is required to enable inter-VLAN communication.Using switches increases the number of collision domains, with each switch port being its own collision domain. Using VLANs does not offer this additional advantage. Spanning tree lets you have loop-free, redundant paths through a switched network. Broadcast traffic does not travel between routers.",
