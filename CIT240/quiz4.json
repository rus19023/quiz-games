The interface negotiates with remote devices to determine the correct settings. However, autonegotiation can be disabled on the Cisco device and/or other Ethernet network hosts. When this happens, devices with autonegotiation enabled try to negotiate link speed and duplexing, but get no response. When autonegotiation fails, Cisco devices that have autonegotiation enabled default to the following:<ul><li>The interface will attempt to sense the link speed, if possible. If not, the slowest link speed supported on the interface is used, which is usually 10 Mbps.</li><li>If the link speed selected is 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps, half-duplex is used. If it is 1000 Mbps or faster, full-duplex is used.</li></ul>In this situation, link speed and duplex mismatches are likely to occur between network devices on the same link.
