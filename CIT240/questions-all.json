The sending device calculates the CRC and adds it to the frame. The receiving device calculates the CRC when the frame is received. If the CRCs do not match, the frame has been corrupted or altered. The most common method of correcting errors is to request retransmission of the original frame. Lost packets are detected by missing sequence numbers or missing acknowledgements. Packet sequence numbers are also used to re-assemble packets into their original order. Flow control uses special messages to speed up or slow down the rate of data transmission.",

The public address allows hosts on the Internet to send packets to the router. To connect a private network, home or business, to the Internet, you must have a router with a public IP address. The public address allows hosts on the Internet to send packets to the router. When connecting a private network to the Internet, only the router interface connected to the Internet needs a public address. You can then use Network Address Translation (NAT) and assign private addresses to hosts on your private network (including all routers on the private network). The NAT router translates your private addresses into the public address. You can even use NAT to place publicly available hosts, such as web servers, on the private network (although these servers are often placed in a special subnet connected to the Internet and assigned public addresses). With port address translation, incoming messages sent to the publicly available servers are relayed to the private network. Servers that hold confidential data, such as database servers, are normally placed on the private network, and can only be contacted directly by the necessary devices (such as a web server).",

The need to keep the Accounting workgroup's traffic secure calls for segmenting them into their own subnet. The router would keep their internal traffic from getting out to the rest of the network. While a Layer 3, or multilayer, switch can also be used to meet these needs, the switch listed here is not specified to be a Layer 3 switch so it is assumed to be a Layer 2 switch, which would not be able to route traffic from one network to another. You can configure virtual LANs (VLANs) for each workgroup on a switch to segment the network, but a router would be required for data to cross between the workgroups. A switch and router used in combination is another solution, but that would not meet the requirement to be the most economical and simple solution.
