        {"category":"CHAPTER4","type":"QUIZ3","difficulty":"EXAM2","question":"You need to design an IPv6 addressing scheme for your network. The following are key requirements for your design: <ul><li>Infrastructure hosts, such as routers and servers, will be assigned static interface IDs while workstations, notebooks, tablets, and phones will be assigned interface IDs dynamically.</li><li>    Internet access must be available to all hosts through an ISP.</li><li>  Site-to-site WAN connections will be created using leased lines.</li></ul> <br> Which type of IPv6 addressing is most appropriate for hosts in this network?","correct_answer":"Global Unicast Addressing","incorrect_answers":["Unique Local Unicast Addressing","Anycast Addressing","Link-Local Addressing"],"explanation":"Global unicast addressing should be used in this scenario because Internet access is required by network hosts. Global unicast addressing uses registered addresses and is equivalent to public addressing in IPv4. Because the addresses are registered with IANA, no other organization can use them on any public network, including the Internet. <br><br> Unique local unicast addresses are private addresses used for communication within a site or between a limited number of sites. These addresses are not registered with IANA and cannot be used on a public network without address translation. <br><br> Link-local addresses are assigned to all IPv6 interfaces on the network by default, but they can only be used on the local subnet. Routers never forward packets destined for local link addresses to other subnets. Anycast addresses are used to locate the nearest server of a specific type, for example the nearest DNS or network time server.","section":"4.1","qnum":"03"},

On Ethernet networks, the modified EUI-64 format interface ID can be automatically derived from the MAC address using the following process: <ol><li> The MAC address is split into 24-bit halves.</li><li>The hex constant FFFE is inserted between the two halves to complete the 64-bit address. For example, 10-01-64-AB-78-96 becomes: 1001:64FF:FEAB:7896 .</li><li> The seventh bit of the MAC address (reading from left to right) is set to binary 1.
