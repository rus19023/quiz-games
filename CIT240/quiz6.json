For each route, the second number in brackets is the route cost.<br>Because each routing protocol uses a different metric to calculate the route cost, the route cost has meaning only within the same routing protocol. In other words, you cannot compare the route cost of a RIP route with the route cost of an OSPF route.<br>The first number in brackets is the administrative distance. The router uses these values to select the source of information to use when multiple routes to a destination exist. A smaller number indicates a more trusted route. The administrative distance is only used in the selection of routes if the router has learned of two routes to the same network through different routing protocols. When that happens, the protocol or route with the lower administrative distance is used. Typically this means that alternate routes will not appear in the routing table.<br>When routing packets, the network address is used to identify the route to use.
