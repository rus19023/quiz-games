In other words, you cannot compare the route cost of a RIP route with the route cost of an OSPF route.<br>The first number in brackets is the administrative distance. The router uses these values to select the source of information to use when multiple routes to a destination exist. A smaller number indicates a more trusted route. The administrative distance is only used in the selection of routes if the router has learned of two routes to the same network through different routing protocols. When that happens, the protocol or route with the lower administrative distance is used. Typically this means that alternate routes will not appear in the routing table.<br>When routing packets, the network address is used to identify the route to use.

        "incorrect_answers__002":"Use the service password-encryption command.",
        "incorrect_answers__003":"Set a password and use the login command for line con 0.",
        "explanation":"Of the security options listed here, configuring Secure Shell (SSH) provides increased security for remote console connections to the router. SSH works much like Telnet, but encrypts the communication for added security. <br>The other security measures listed can improve the security of your router, but do not have a direct effect on remote console connections. Configuring the line con 0 affects direct console connections through the console port. Keeping the router in a locked room increases the physical security and helps prevent unauthorized console access. Configuring the enable secret password helps control access to privileged EXEC modes and configuration modes after a session has been established. The service password-encryption command uses a weak form of encryption to encrypt passwords in the configuration file. It protects against people accidentally reading the passwords, but cannot fully protect them as the encryption can be easily broken.",

Because the port light was off when Duplex was selected, you know it is operating at half-duplex.<br>A solid light with Speed selected indicates 100 Mbps.
